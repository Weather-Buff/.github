## Future Enhancements

We are committed to bettering the student experience by continuously adding Quality of Life features to Weather Buff. Our goal is to ensure that interactions with the university's facilities are as seamless and enjoyable as possible. While some aren't possible without collaboration with the university, here’s a preview of some exciting features we’re planning and working on:

- **Outside of Recreation**: Hopefully soon, you'll be able to have a mobile BuffOne Card, and even use it to scan into buildings.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Soon, you’ll receive tailored suggestions based on your preferences and usage history, helping you find the ideal times and facilities that best suit your needs.
- **Interactive Maps**: We plan to integrate interactive maps with detailed information on facility locations, amenities, and accessibility, making navigation and planning easier.
- **Enhanced Data Visualization**: Advanced visualization tools are on the way to provide clearer insights into usage trends and predictions through more detailed charts and graphs.
- **Improved Accessibility Features**: We are focused on enhancing accessibility options to ensure Weather Buff is user-friendly for all students, including those with disabilities.
